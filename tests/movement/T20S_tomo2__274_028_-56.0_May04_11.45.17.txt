-InMrc         
  1. Input MRC file that stores dose fractionated stacks.
  2. It can be a MRC file containing a single stack collected
     in Leginon or multiple stacks collected in UcsfTomo.
  3. It can also be the path of a folder containing multiple
     MRC files when -Serial option is turned on.

-InTiff        
  1. Input TIFF file that stores a dose fractionated stack.
-OutMrc        
  1. Output MRC file that stores the frame sum.
  2. It can be either a MRC file name or the prefix of a series
     MRC files when -Serial option is turned on.

-ArcDir        
 1. Path of the archive folder that holds the archived raw
    stacks with each pixel packed into 4 bits.
 2. The archived stacks are saved in MRC file with the gain
    reference saved in the extended header.
 3. The rotated and/or flipped gain reference will be saved
    if -RotGain and or -FlipGain are enabled.

-FullSum       
 1. MRC file for global-motion corrected, unweighted sum.
 2. This file is generated as soon as the global motion
    correction is completed while the program continues
    lengthy local motion correction. This file allows users
    to perform CTF estimate to gain quick feedback on the
    image quality.
 3. This file is temporary, when the next stack is processed,
    its content will be overwritten.

-DefectFile    
1. Defect file that stores entries of defects on camera.
2. Each entry corresponds to a rectangular region in image.
   The pixels in such a region are replaced by neighboring
   good pixel values.
3. Each entry contains 4 integers x, y, w, h representing
   the x, y coordinates, width, and heights, respectively.

-Serial        
  1. Serial-processing all MRC files in a given folder whose
     name should be specified following -InMrc.
  2. The output MRC file name emplate should be provided
     folllowing -OutMrc
  3. 1 - serial processing, 0 - single processing, default.
  4. This option is only for single-particle stack files.

-Gain          
   MRC file that stores the gain reference. If not
   specified, MRC extended header will be visited
   to look for gain reference.

-TmpFile       
   Temporary image file for debugging.

-LogFile       
   Log file storing alignment data.

-Patch         
   Number of patches to be used for patch based

   Center of subarea that will be used for alignement,
   default 0 0 corresponding to the frame center.

-MaskSize      
   The size of subarea that will be used for alignment,
   default 1.0 1.0 corresponding full size.

-Iter          
   Maximum iterations for iterative alignment,
   default 5 iterations.

-Tol

   B-Factor for alignment, default 100.

-PhaseOnly     
   Only phase is used in cross correlation.
   default is 0, i.e., false.

-StackZ        
   Number of frames per stack. If not specified,
   it will be loaded from MRC header.

-FtBin         
   Binning performed in Fourier space, default 1.0.

-InitDose      
   Initial dose received before stack is acquired

-FmDose        
   Frame dose in e/A^2. If not specified, dose
   weighting will be skipped.

-PixSize       
   Pixel size in A of input stack in angstrom. If not
   specified, dose weighting will be skipped.

-kV            
   High tension in kV needed for dose weighting.
   Default is 300.

-Align         
   Generate aligned sum (1) or simple sum (0)

-Throw         
   Throw initial number of frames, default is 0

-Trunc         
   Truncate last number of frames, default is 0

-Group         
   Group every specified number of frames by adding
   them together. The alignment is then performed
   on the summed frames. By default, no grouping
   is performed.

-Crop          
   1. Crop the loaded frames to the given size.
   2. By default the original size is loaded.

-FmRef         
   Specify which frame to be the reference to which
   all other frames are aligned. By default (-1) the
   the central frame is chosen. The central frame is
   at N/2 based upon zero indexing where N is the
   number of frames that will be summed, i.e., not
   including the frames thrown away.

-Tilt          
   Specify the starting angle and the step angle of tilt
   series. They are required for dose weighting. If not
   given, dose weighting will be disabled.

-RotGain       
   Rotate gain reference counter-clockwise.
   0 - no rotation, default,
   1 - rotate 90 degree,
   2 - rotate 180 degree,
   3 - rotate 270 degree.

-FlipGain      
   Flip gain reference after gain rotation.
   0 - no flipping, default,
   1 - flip upside down, 
   2 - flip left right.

-Mag           
   1. Correct anisotropic magnification by stretching
      image along the major axis, the axis where the
      lower magificantion is detected.
   2. Three inputs are needed including magnifications
      along major and minor axes and the angle of the
      major axis relative to the image x-axis in degree.
   3. By default no correction is performed.

-InFmMotion    
   1. 1 - Account for in-frame motion.
      0 - Do not account for in-frame motion.

-Gpu           
   GPU IDs. Default 0.
   For multiple GPUs, separate IDs by space.
   For example, -Gpu 0 1 2 3 specifies 4 GPUs.
